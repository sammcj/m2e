"Freedom isn't free, but the refills sure are!" as we like to say. God bless our troops, God bless capitalism, and God bless the U-S-A, where the portions are supersized, the football ain't soccer, and "we spell 'color,' 'flavor,' 'humor,' and 'neighbor' without that commie 'u'" because "ain't nobody got time for extra letters!"

I’ll defend to the death my right to use "aluminum" instead of "aluminium," "realize" instead of "realise," and to put my kids through "pediatric" not "paediatric" care — "that's the flavor of liberty, y'all!"
