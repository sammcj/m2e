# This is a test file with American spellings.

"Freedom isn't free, but the refills sure are!" as we like to say. God bless our troops, God bless capitalism, and God bless the U-S-A, where the portions are supersized, the football ain't soccer, and "we spell 'colour,' 'flavour,' 'humour,' and 'neighbour' without that commie 'u'" because "ain't nobody got time for extra letters!"

I'll defend to the death my right to use "aluminium" instead of "aluminium," "realise" instead of "realise," and to put my kids through "paediatric" not "paediatric" care - "that's the flavour of liberty, y'all!"

I need to organise my favourite colours and analyse the behaviour of the programme.
The centre of the theatre has been modernised with new technology.
We should prioritise optimisation and recognise the importance of standardisation.

## Testing code comments

Below we should replace all Americanisations in the comments:

// This function optimises the colour algorithm
/* We need to analyse the behaviour here */

## Testing "real" code

Below we should not replace the constant naming:

const mum = "mother"

## Testing code inside markdown code blocks

Below we should only replace comments:

```python
const mom = "mother" // But change this mum
```
